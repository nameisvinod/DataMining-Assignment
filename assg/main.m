%% =================== Part 1: K-Means Clustering ======================
%  After you have completed the two functions computeCentroids and
%  findClosestCentroids, you have all the necessary pieces to run the
%  kMeans algorithm. In this part, you will run the K-Means algorithm on
%  the example dataset we have provided.

fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on example dataset.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset
load('ex7data2.mat');

% Settings for running K-Means
K = 3;
max_iters = 10;

% For consistency, here we set centroids to specific values
% but in practice you want to generate them automatically, such as by
% settings them to be random examples (as can be seen in
% kMeansInitCentroids).
initial_centroids = [3 3; 6 2; 8 5];

% Run K-Means algorithm. The 'true' at the end tells our function to plot
% the progress of K-Means
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, true);
